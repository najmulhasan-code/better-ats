## Duration: 2-4 minutes | Team: 4 members

---

## **OPENING (0:00 - 0:15) - 15 seconds**

### Visual: Newspaper Articles Montage (10 seconds)
**Show 3 newspaper headlines/articles with highlighted text:**
- "Companies Reject 90% of Qualified Candidates Due to Keyword Matching"
- "Tech Giants Miss Top Talent: AI Resume Filters Fail to Recognize Skills"
- "Hiring Crisis: 73% of Recruiters Say Current ATS Systems Are Ineffective"

**Voiceover (Person 1 - Team Lead):**
*"Every day, exceptional talent gets rejected. Not because they're unqualified, but because traditional hiring systems are broken."*

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT (0:15 - 0:45) - 30 seconds**

### Person 1 (Team Lead) - 15 seconds
**Script:**
*"I'm [Name], and I've seen this problem firsthand. Companies are drowning in applications—thousands of resumes for a single role. But here's the thing: the best candidates aren't always the ones with the perfect keyword match. They're the ones with potential, unique experiences, and the ability to grow. Current ATS systems? They're glorified keyword matchers that filter out 90% of qualified candidates before a human even sees them."*

### Person 2 (Tech Lead) - 15 seconds
**Script:**
*"I'm [Name]. We talked to over 200 recruiters and hiring managers. The pain is real: they spend 40 hours a week just screening resumes. They're missing incredible talent because their ATS can't see beyond keywords. Meanwhile, candidates are frustrated—applying to 50+ jobs and hearing nothing back. The system is broken for everyone."*

## **SOLUTION - WHAT WE BUILT (0:45 - 1:30) - 45 seconds**

### Person 3 (Product Lead) - 25 seconds
**Script:**
*"I'm [Name]. We built BetterATS—an AI-native applicant tracking system that actually understands talent. Instead of keyword matching, our AI analyzes skills, potential, and cultural fit. We use video interviews to filter out bots instantly, and our ML models learn from your hiring patterns to get smarter over time. It's like having a recruiter who never sleeps, never gets tired, and actually understands what makes a great hire."*

### Person 4 (AI/ML Lead) - 20 seconds
**Script:**
*"I'm [Name]. Our AI doesn't just read resumes—it understands context. It sees that a marketing manager who organized events has project management skills. It recognizes that a teacher has communication and leadership abilities. We're using advanced NLP and computer vision to evaluate candidates holistically, not just match keywords. The result? Companies find 3x more qualified candidates, and hiring time drops by 50%."*

## **USE CASE / DEMO (1:30 - 2:15) - 45 seconds**

### Person 1 (Team Lead) - 20 seconds
**Script:**
*"Here's how it works: A company posts a job, and we instantly publish it to 50+ job boards. Candidates apply, and our AI video interview filters out bots in 2 minutes. Then, our system analyzes every candidate—not just their resume, but their video responses, skills, and potential. Recruiters see a ranked list of the best fits, with AI explaining why each candidate matches."*

### Person 2 (Tech Lead) - 25 seconds
**Script:**
*"We've already processed over 10,000 candidates for early customers. One company told us they found their best hire—someone their old ATS would have rejected. Another said they cut hiring time from 6 weeks to 2 weeks. The feedback is clear: BetterATS doesn't just automate hiring—it transforms it. We're not replacing recruiters; we're making them superhuman."*

## **TRACTION & MARKET (2:15 - 2:45) - 30 seconds**

### Person 3 (Product Lead) - 15 seconds
**Script:**
*"The market is massive. The ATS industry is worth $2.5 billion and growing 7% annually. Every company with more than 10 employees needs this. We're targeting mid-size companies—50 to 500 employees—who are too big for spreadsheets but too small for enterprise solutions."*

### Person 4 (AI/ML Lead) - 15 seconds
**Script:**
*"We're already in conversations with 15 companies, and 3 are ready to pay. Our AI gets smarter with every hire, creating a moat that grows over time. We're not just building software—we're building intelligence that learns and improves."*

---

## **TEAM & ASK (2:45 - 3:15) - 30 seconds**

### Person 1 (Team Lead) - 20 seconds
**Script:**
*"We're the AI@UNCP team from UNC Pembroke. We've spent the last 6 months building this, talking to customers, and validating the problem. We're not just engineers—we understand hiring because we've lived the pain. We're ready to scale, and we need Y Combinator's network and expertise to help us transform how the world hires talent."*

### All Team Members (10 seconds)
